## Data Flow

CascadeUI follows a **unidirectional data flow** pattern. Every state change
traces the same path -- no scattered mutation, no surprise side effects:

```

│                                                                 │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:** mutating a variable inside a callback does not update the
UI. The state store is the single source of truth. To change what the user sees:
dispatch an action, let the reducer transform state, and let the subscriber
pipeline handle the rest.

For the full details -- custom reducers, subscribers, selectors, batching -- see
the [State Management](state.md) guide.

## Sessions, Views, and Navigation

CascadeUI organizes runtime state into two layers plus a navigation mechanism:

```
Session (e.g. "SettingsView:user_123_guild_456")
│
├── Members: [view_id_a, view_id_b, ...]
├── Shared Data: { cross-view metadata }
└── History: [ store debug audit trail ]

View (e.g. "SettingsHub")
│
├── Nav Stack: [parent_entry, ...]    ← view-local, forward-transferred on push/pop
├── Undo/Redo Stacks                  ← view-local, per enable_undo opt-in
└── Custom state from dispatched actions
```

### How the layers interact

| Concept | What it is | Lifetime |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **View** | A single UI screen (one Discord message). Created on `send()`, destroyed on `exit()`, `on_timeout()`, `on_message_delete()`, or instance replacement (`on_replaced()` then `exit()`). | Until the message is exited, deleted, replaced, or times out. |
| **Session** | A coordination group for views sharing metadata. Created automatically when the root view calls `send()`. | Until the last member exits. |
| **Navigation** | View-local push/pop stack. `push()` replaces the current view, `pop()` reconstructs the previous one. `replace()` is a one-way transition with no return path. | Carried per-view, forward-transferred through push/pop chains. |

### Instance limiting

`instance_limit` caps how many **instances** of a view class a user can have
open. A user who opens a settings hub, pushes into a sub-page, and pushes
again still occupies one instance (pushed views inherit the root's identity).

`instance_scope` controls the indexing key:

| Scope | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `"user"` | Per-user globally | One settings panel per user, any guild |
| `"guild"` | Per-guild | One panel per guild, any user |
| `"user_guild"` | Per-user per-guild *(default)* | One panel per user in each guild |
| `"global"` | Singleton | One panel total, for everyone |

When a new instance would exceed the limit, `instance_policy` decides the
outcome:

- `"replace"` *(default)* -- the old view is exited (governed by
  `replace_policy`) and the new one takes its place. Views with active
  participants or attached children from other users are protected by default
  (`protect_attached = True`). `on_replaced()` fires on the old view before
  teardown.
- `"reject"` -- the new `send()` is blocked; `on_instance_limit` fires and
  `send()` returns `None`

For the full architectural model behind these attributes, see
[The Five Pillar Model](five-pillars.md). For the detailed Views API, see
[Views](views.md).

## State Topology

The state store holds a single dict. Understanding its shape makes debugging
and custom reducers straightforward:

```
state
├── views/                    (ephemeral - cleared on restart)
│   └── <view_id>/
│       ├── type, user_id, guild_id, channel_id
│       ├── message_id, created_at
│       ├── nav_stack: [...]       (view-local navigation breadcrumb)
│       ├── undo_stack: [...]      (view-local, when enable_undo=True)
│       ├── redo_stack: [...]      (view-local)
│       └── custom data from dispatched actions
│
├── sessions/                 (ephemeral - cleared on restart)
│   └── <session_id>/
│       ├── members: [view_id, ...]
│       ├── shared_data: { ... }   (cross-view metadata via update_session())
│       ├── history: [...]
│       └── created_at, updated_at
│
├── components/               (ephemeral - pruned on restart)
│   └── <component_custom_id>/
│       ├── view_id, type, last_interaction
│       └── interaction_count
│
├── modals/                   (ephemeral - pruned on restart)
│   └── <modal_view_id>/
│       └── type, submitted_at
│
├── persistent_views/         (survives restart)
│   └── <persistence_key>/
│       ├── class_name, channel_id, message_id
│       ├── user_id, guild_id
│       └── custom data
│
└── application/              (user-managed, persists via opt-in slots)
    ├── <slot_name>/          (custom keys set by dispatched actions)
    │   └── ...
    │
    ├── scoped/               (ad-hoc bucket for dispatch_scoped)
    │   ├── user:<id>/
    │   ├── guild:<id>/
    │   ├── user_guild:<uid>:<gid>/
    │   └── global/
    │
    └── <named_scoped_slot>/  (opt-in via scoped_slot class attribute)
        ├── user:<id>/
        ├── guild:<id>/
        ├── user_guild:<uid>:<gid>/
        └── global/
```

**Ephemeral** entries (`views`, `sessions`, `components`, `modals`)
are rebuilt or pruned on every restart. They represent live runtime state.

**Persistent** entries (`persistent_views`, opt-in `application` slots)
survive restarts when a [persistence backend](persistence.md) is configured.
Scoped buckets live under `application` and follow the same opt-in rules --
a scoped slot persists when its slot name is declared in `persistent_slots`
or registered via `SlotPolicy(persistent=True)`; otherwise it stays
in-memory.

See [State Management](state.md) for working with the store, and
[Persistence](persistence.md) for backend setup.

## Policy Surface

Every view class exposes a set of **class attributes** that control its
behavior. Set them on the class body -- the library reads them at definition
time via `__init_subclass__`. Each attribute pairs with either an `on_*` method
hook (for dynamic override) or a `*_message` attribute (for static text).

### Behavior Policies

Attributes are grouped by [pillar](five-pillars.md). See the
[Five Pillars Quick Reference](five-pillars.md#quick-reference) for the
complete list with defaults.

| Attribute | Default | Controls | Dynamic Override |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `owner_only` | `True` | Reject interactions from non-owners | `on_unauthorized()` |
| `unauthorized_message` | `"You cannot interact with this."` | Ephemeral rejection text | `on_unauthorized()` |
| `instance_limit` | `None` (unlimited) | Max concurrent instances per scope | `on_instance_limit()` |
| `instance_limit_message` | `None` | Rejection text on limit hit | `on_instance_limit()` |
| `instance_scope` | `"user_guild"` | Instance limit indexing key | -- |
| `instance_policy` | `"replace"` | What happens when limit exceeded: `"replace"` or `"reject"` | -- |
| `replace_policy` | `"delete"` | What happens to the old view on replace: `"delete"` or `"disable"` | -- |
| `exit_policy` | `"disable"` | Bare `exit()` behavior: `"disable"` (freeze) or `"delete"` | -- |
| `participant_limit` | `None` (unlimited) | Max total occupants (owner + participants) | `on_participant_limit()` |
| `participant_limit_message` | `"This session is full."` | Rejection text on capacity hit | `on_participant_limit()` |
| `auto_register_participants` | `False` | Auto-register `allowed_users` on `send()` | -- |
| `protect_attached` | `True` | Block replacement when other users are attached | `on_instance_limit()` (fallback) |
| `replaced_message` | `None` | Channel notification when a view is replaced | `on_replaced()` |
| `error_message` | `"An unexpected error occurred..."` | Ephemeral error embed description | `on_error()` |
| `reopen_failure_message` | `"Could not refresh this view..."` | Ephemeral text when ephemeral refresh fails | `on_reopen_failure()` |
| `state_scope` | `None` | Scoped state key: `"user"`, `"guild"`, `"user_guild"`, `"global"` | -- |
| `scoped_slot` | `None` | Named bucket for scoped writes (routes to `state["application"][slot]`); `None` uses the default `scoped` bucket | -- |

### Lifecycle and Interaction

| Attribute | Default | Controls |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `timeout` | `180` | Seconds before `on_timeout()` fires (`None` = no timeout) |
| `auto_defer` | `True` | Auto-defer unacknowledged interactions |
| `auto_defer_delay` | `2.5` | Seconds before auto-defer fires |
| `serialize_interactions` | `True` | Process button clicks sequentially (prevents racing edits) |
| `auto_refresh_ephemeral` | `None` | Engages the 15-min ephemeral refresh handoff. `None` derives from `timeout` (in-window declines, longer engages); set `True`/`False` to pin. |
| `refresh_warning_seconds` | `90` | How early (in seconds) to swap in the refresh button before the 900s wall |
| `refresh_button_label` | `"Continue Session"` | Label on the ephemeral refresh button |
| `refresh_button_style` | `ButtonStyle.primary` | Style of the ephemeral refresh button |
| `auto_back_button` | `False` | Add a back button when pushed onto a nav stack |
| `enable_undo` | `False` | Track undo/redo history for this view |
| `undo_limit` | `20` | Max undo snapshots |
| `refresh_cooldown_ms` | `None` | Proactive edit cooldown in milliseconds; refreshes during the window schedule one deferred edit and re-read store state at fire time |

### The three-tier precedence model

Every policy attribute follows the same precedence:

1. **Class attribute** -- the default, set on the class body
2. **Method override** -- `on_*` hooks for dynamic behavior
3. **Explicit argument** -- e.g. `exit(delete_message=True)` always wins

```python
class MyView(StatefulLayoutView):
    exit_policy = "disable"             # 1. Class default: freeze on exit

    async def on_timeout(self):
        await self.exit(delete_message=True)  # 3. Explicit arg overrides policy
```

## Component Tiers

Discord.py components fall into three categories based on how they interact
with the state store:

### Tier 1: Interactive Components

These fire standalone `INTERACTION_CREATE` events. CascadeUI wraps them with
automatic `COMPONENT_INTERACTION` dispatching:

| CascadeUI Class | Wraps | Interaction |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| `StatefulButton` | `discord.ui.Button` | Click → callback → `COMPONENT_INTERACTION` |
| `StatefulSelect` | `discord.ui.Select` | Selection → callback → `COMPONENT_INTERACTION` |
| `Dropdown` | alias for `StatefulSelect` | Same |
| `RoleSelect` | `discord.ui.RoleSelect` | Role selection → callback |
| `ChannelSelect` | `discord.ui.ChannelSelect` | Channel selection → callback |
| `UserSelect` | `discord.ui.UserSelect` | User selection → callback |
| `MentionableSelect` | `discord.ui.MentionableSelect` | Mentionable selection → callback |

Use these for buttons and selects in both V1 and V2 views. Each click
dispatches a `COMPONENT_INTERACTION` action to the state store for tracking
and debugging.

### Tier 2: Modal Inputs

These live inside `Modal` dialogs. They have `custom_id` attributes but
`is_dispatchable = False` -- they do not fire standalone events. Instead, the
Modal collects all input values on submit and fires a single
`MODAL_SUBMITTED` action:

| CascadeUI Class | Wraps | Value Type |
|----------------|-------|-----------|
| `TextInput` | `discord.ui.TextInput` | `str` |
| `Checkbox` | `discord.ui.Checkbox` | `bool` |
| `CheckboxGroup` | `discord.ui.CheckboxGroup` | `list[str]` |
| `RadioGroup` | `discord.ui.RadioGroup` | `str` |
| `FileUpload` | `discord.ui.FileUpload` | `list` |

All five share the same contract: `custom_id` derived from label,
optional `validators` list, and automatic value write-back on submit.
See [Components -- Modal Inputs](components.md#modal-inputs) for usage.

### Tier 3: Display-Only Components

These are pure rendering -- no `custom_id`, no interaction, no state store
involvement:

`TextDisplay`, `Container`, `Section`, `Separator`, `MediaGallery`,
`Thumbnail`, `ActionRow`, `File`

CascadeUI provides builder functions (`card()`, `key_value()`, `alert()`,
`divider()`, `gallery()`, etc.) that produce these components with less
boilerplate. See [Components -- V2 Builders](components.md#v2-builder-functions).

---

## Extension Strategies

Component Tiers groups primitives by *what they do* (fire events, submit
values, render). Extension Strategies groups them by *how CascadeUI extends
discord.py*. The two axes are orthogonal and both matter: knowing a
component's tier tells you when Discord calls it; knowing its extension
strategy tells you how to compose it into your own code.

CascadeUI uses four strategies. Each answers a different question.

| Strategy | What it does | Examples | When to reach for it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Subclass** | Extends a `discord.ui.*` primitive with behavior baked into the type | `StatefulButton`, `StatefulSelect`, `StatefulView`, `StatefulLayoutView`, `PersistentView`, `PersistentLayoutView` | Behavior is identity-coupled: callback dispatch, state binding, `custom_id` contracts, lifecycle hooks |
| **Builder function** | Returns a bare `discord.ui.*` instance pre-wired with sensible defaults | `card()`, `action_section()`, `image_section()`, `link_section()`, `confirm_section()`, `stats_card()`, `progress_bar()`, `button_row()`, `tab_nav()` | A layout primitive just needs composition shorthand -- no new type, no state, just a cleaner call site |
| **Wrapper / decorator** | Augments an existing component instance with orthogonal behavior | `with_loading_state`, `with_confirmation`, `with_cooldown` | The behavior applies to *any* button, not just a specific subclass -- loading UI, confirmation prompts, and cooldowns all compose onto the same primitive |
| **Pre-built pattern** | Complete multi-component fragment solving a recognizable problem | `ConfirmationButtons`, `PaginationControls`, `ToggleGroup`, `ProgressBar` (V1 composites), `emoji_grid`, `button_grid` | The problem appears often enough to ship a named solution |

### What CascadeUI deliberately does NOT subclass

The V2 layout primitives stay bare: `Container`, `Section`, `Separator`,
`MediaGallery`, `Thumbnail`, `ActionRow`, `TextDisplay`, `File`.

Three reasons these stay unwrapped:

1. **Pure rendering.** No callback, no state, no lifecycle -- there is nothing
   a subclass could integrate with the store.
2. **No customization surface.** Discord renders these client-side with fixed
   layouts; discord.py exposes only the data they carry. A subclass would
   forward `__init__` to the parent and add nothing.
3. **Builders scale better.** Five builder functions around `Section`
   (`action_section`, `toggle_section`, `image_section`, `link_section`,
   `confirm_section`) produce more discoverable, more composable code than
   five `Section` subclasses. Functions show up in module listings;
   subclasses hide in inheritance trees.

If Discord ever ships a customization point for one of these primitives
(e.g. a left-aligned `Section` accessory), the response is a new builder or
a kwarg on an existing one -- not a new subclass hierarchy.

### The mental test

- **Subclass** when behavior needs to live on the type (callback dispatch,
  state binding, identity-coupled contracts).
- **Build** when a bare primitive just needs better defaults (no new type,
  no state, just composition).
- **Wrap** when behavior is orthogonal and composable (loading, cooldowns,
  confirmation -- any of which should apply to any button).
- **Pattern** when a recognizable problem is worth naming.

This ordering also tracks cost: a subclass is the heaviest commitment
(adds a type to the public surface), a builder is the lightest (adds a
function), a wrapper is mid-weight (adds behavior without a type), and a
pre-built pattern is whatever composition the problem demands.

## Discord Interactions

Every button click, select choice, and modal submit in Discord produces an
**interaction** -- a one-shot request from Discord to your bot. Understanding
the interaction lifecycle is worth the time: it explains why CascadeUI's
auto-defer, `respond()`, and `refresh()` work the way they do, and when you
need to step outside them.

### Interaction Types

Not all interactions are the same. Discord defines several types, and they
behave differently:

| Type | When it fires | Where you see it |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| `APPLICATION_COMMAND` | Slash commands, context menus | Your cog command handler, before `view.send()` |
| `MESSAGE_COMPONENT` | Button clicks, select menus | CascadeUI component callbacks |
| `MODAL_SUBMIT` | Modal form submitted | CascadeUI `Modal` callback |
| `APPLICATION_COMMAND_AUTOCOMPLETE` | Autocomplete suggestions | Outside CascadeUI scope |

The type matters because `defer()` behaves differently depending on it:

| Interaction type | `defer()` behavior |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| `APPLICATION_COMMAND` | Shows "Bot is thinking..." (visible loading indicator) |
| `MESSAGE_COMPONENT` | Silent acknowledgement (no visual change) |
| `MODAL_SUBMIT` | Silent acknowledgement |

This is the most common source of confusion: `defer()` in a slash command
handler shows a thinking indicator, but `defer()` in a component callback
produces no visible change. They are different Discord response types under
the hood. discord.py's `thinking=` parameter can override this, but forcing
`thinking=True` on a component interaction creates a *second* message (the
thinking indicator) that must be manually dismissed -- it does not modify the
original component message. CascadeUI's `with_loading_state` wrapper is a
cleaner solution for visual loading feedback on components:

```python
btn = with_loading_state(
    StatefulButton(label="Generate", callback=self.on_generate),
    loading_label="Generating...",
    loading_emoji="⏳",
)
```

This disables the button and swaps its label on the *existing* message while
the callback runs, then restores it automatically. No second message, no
manual cleanup.

### The Response Slot

Each interaction has exactly **one response slot**. The bot must fill it within
3 seconds or Discord shows "This interaction failed." Four options:

| Method | What it does | Creates a new message? |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| `interaction.response.defer()` | Acknowledge (silent for components, "thinking" for commands) | No |
| `interaction.response.edit_message()` | Edit the message the component is on | No |
| `interaction.response.send_message()` | Send a new message as the reply | Yes |
| `interaction.response.send_modal()` | Open a modal dialog | No (opens UI) |

Once any of these is called, `interaction.response.is_done()` returns `True`.
Calling a second one raises `InteractionResponded`. The slot is consumed -- no
take-backs.

### After the Response

After the one-shot response, `interaction.followup` provides unlimited
follow-up messages for the rest of the token's 15-minute lifetime:

```python
# Response slot consumed by defer
await interaction.response.defer()

# Followups work any number of times after that
await interaction.followup.send("First followup", ephemeral=True)
await interaction.followup.send("Second followup", ephemeral=True)

# Edit the deferred response (the original message)
await interaction.edit_original_response(content="Updated")
```

### Two Ways to Edit a Message

This distinction matters for long-lived views:

| Path | Method | Token Expiry | When to use |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interaction endpoint** | `interaction.edit_original_response()` | 15 minutes | Immediate edits tied to a specific click |
| **Channel endpoint** | `message.edit()` | Never | Background updates, state-driven refreshes |

CascadeUI's `refresh()` prefers the acting-view fast path when possible:
if the current component click targets the view's own message and the
response slot is still open, the refresh ships through
`interaction.response.edit_message()` in one HTTP round trip (ack + edit
combined). If any gate fails -- no bound interaction, response already
deferred, cross-view dispatch, modal submit -- `refresh()` falls through
to the channel endpoint (`self._message.edit()`), which has no token
expiry and works indefinitely. `exit()` always uses the channel endpoint,
so it works whether or not the interaction has been responded to.

This is why pattern component callbacks in CascadeUI deliberately do not
pre-defer: a manual `defer()` would consume the response slot and force
every refresh through the slower two-call channel path.

### Ephemeral Message Constraints

Ephemeral messages ("Only you can see this") have restrictions that affect
how CascadeUI manages them:

| Constraint | What it means |
|-----------|--------------|
| Not fetchable | `channel.fetch_message(id)` returns `NotFound`. CascadeUI skips the post-send re-fetch for ephemeral views. |
| Only editable via interaction token | The channel endpoint (`message.edit()`) cannot edit ephemeral messages. Only `interaction.edit_original_response()` works, and the token expires after 15 minutes. |
| Not deletable via channel | `message.delete()` fails. Only `interaction.delete_original_response()` works, and it shares the same 15-minute token. |
| No reactions | Discord rejects reaction adds on ephemeral messages. |
| Followups are not auto-ephemeral | `interaction.followup.send()` is public by default. Pass `ephemeral=True` explicitly on each followup. |

The 15-minute token expiry is the reason `auto_refresh_ephemeral` exists.
Without it, an ephemeral view becomes uneditable after 15 minutes -- buttons
still fire callbacks, but `refresh()` silently fails because the channel
endpoint cannot reach the message. CascadeUI's ephemeral refresh system swaps
in a "Continue Session" button before the token expires, allowing the user to
click it and spawn a fresh ephemeral view via a new interaction token.

### The CascadeUI Callback Lifecycle

When a user clicks a button or selects an option, the interaction passes
through CascadeUI's `_scheduled_task` pipeline before reaching your callback.
Here is the full sequence:

```
Interaction arrives from Discord
        │
        ▼
interaction_check(interaction)
├── allowed_users set?  → only users in the set pass
├── owner_only = True?  → only the view creator passes
└── Failed?             → on_unauthorized() fires, callback skipped
        │
        ▼ (passed)
Timeout refreshed (resets the inactivity clock)
        │
        ├── auto_defer = True?
        │   └── Background timer starts (auto_defer_delay seconds)
        │       If the callback hasn't responded by then, defer() fires
        │
        ▼
serialize_interactions = True?
├── Yes → acquire asyncio.Lock (queued clicks wait here)
│         Auto-defer timer runs OUTSIDE the lock, so queued

The auto-defer timer and post-callback defer both check `is_done()` before
acting, so they never conflict with a response your callback already sent.

### What CascadeUI Handles for You

Most callbacks never touch `interaction.response` directly. The library
provides four tools that cover the common cases:

**Auto-defer** (`auto_defer = True`, the default) -- two mechanisms ensure
every interaction is acknowledged:

1. A background timer defers unacknowledged interactions after
   `auto_defer_delay` seconds (default 2.5), handling slow callbacks.
2. A post-callback defer fires after every callback completes, handling
   fast callbacks that edit via the channel endpoint (the common
   `dispatch() → on_state_changed → refresh()` pattern). Without this,
   fast callbacks that finish before the timer fires would leave the
   interaction unacknowledged.

**`self.respond()`** -- sends a message to the user, routing through
`interaction.response.send_message()` when the slot is available or
`interaction.followup.send()` when auto-defer already consumed it. Use
this instead of `interaction.response.send_message()` in callbacks:

```python
async def my_callback(self, interaction):
    if not valid:
        await self.respond(interaction, "Invalid input!", ephemeral=True)
        return
    # ... normal state update
```

**`self.open_modal()`** -- opens a modal dialog, with a fallback if the
response slot is already consumed. `send_modal()` must be the first
response to an interaction -- it cannot follow a `defer()`. Under
`serialize_interactions`, a queued interaction may be auto-deferred before
the callback runs, making `send_modal()` impossible. `open_modal()` checks
`is_done()` and sends an ephemeral "please try again" fallback instead of
crashing:

```python
async def on_edit(self, interaction):
    modal = Modal(title="Edit", inputs=[...], callback=self.handle_edit)
    await self.open_modal(interaction, modal)
```

Returns `True` if the modal opened, `False` if the fallback fired.

**`self.refresh()`** -- edits the message via the channel endpoint (no
interaction involvement). Call it after `build_ui()` to push the new
component tree to Discord. Works at any time, not just during a callback.

**Interaction serialization** (`serialize_interactions = True`, the default) --
an `asyncio.Lock` ensures rapid button clicks are processed one at a time,
preventing racing `message.edit()` calls. Queued interactions are auto-deferred
while waiting for the lock, so Discord never shows "This interaction failed."

**Update coalescing** -- when multiple dispatches from independent views
converge on the same subscriber simultaneously (e.g. two players clicking at
the same time in a game), the subscriber notifications are coalesced
automatically. The first notification runs `on_state_changed` normally; any
that arrive while it is running set a pending flag and return immediately.
After the first completes, it re-runs once with the latest store state.
Single-user views are unaffected - the lock is never contended.

**ViewStore interaction preservation** -- when `build_ui()` calls
`clear_items()`, discord.py internally nulls the `_view` reference on every
removed component. Components remain in discord.py's routing table until
`message.edit()` triggers a re-registration. During that async gap, any pending
interaction for the old components would be silently discarded. CascadeUI's
`clear_items()` override preserves the `_view` reference on old components, so
interactions arriving during the gap are routed normally until the
re-registration cleans them up.

Together, these mechanisms form four layers of concurrency protection:

| Layer | Scope | Protects against |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| Interaction serialization | Per-view callbacks | Rapid clicks on the same view |
| Auto-defer timer | Per-interaction | Slow callbacks missing Discord's 3-second deadline |
| Update coalescing | Per-view subscriber | Concurrent dispatches targeting the same subscriber |
| ViewStore preservation | Per-view components | Stale component routing during async rebuilds |

### The Standard Callback Pattern

Most CascadeUI callbacks follow this shape:

```python
async def on_click(self, interaction):
    # 1. Validate (optional)
    if not valid:
        await self.respond(interaction, "Error!", ephemeral=True)
        return

    # 2. Update state
    await self.dispatch("MY_ACTION", {"key": value})
    # → triggers on_state_changed() → build_ui() → refresh()
    # → post-callback defer acknowledges the interaction

    # No manual defer needed. No manual message edit needed.
```

The `dispatch() → on_state_changed → refresh()` chain edits the message
via the channel endpoint and the post-callback defer acknowledges the
interaction. Both happen automatically.

### When You Need Manual Interaction Handling

| Scenario | What to do |
|----------|-----------|
| Sending multiple followup messages | First `self.respond()`, then `interaction.followup.send()` for additional messages |
| Editing via the interaction token | `await interaction.edit_original_response(...)` -- rarely needed, `refresh()` handles most cases |
| Working outside CascadeUI | Raw discord.py callbacks have no auto-defer -- `defer()` is your responsibility |

### V1 vs V2 Editing

V1 views (embeds + buttons) and V2 views (component trees) differ in how
they handle message content:

| Aspect | V1 (`StatefulView`) | V2 (`StatefulLayoutView`) |
|--------|----|----|
| Content model | Embed(s) + buttons attached via `view=` | The component tree IS the content |
| `refresh()` | Pass `embed=` or `content=` kwargs | No kwargs needed -- `view=self` is the content |
| `exit()` with disable | `edit(view=None)` strips buttons, embed stays | `_freeze_components()` + `edit(view=self)` preserves frozen UI |
| `exit()` with delete | `message.delete()` | `message.delete()` |
| Empty message | Embed visible with no buttons | `edit(view=None)` produces an empty message (Discord error 50006) |

V2 views cannot use `edit(view=None)` to "strip components" the way V1 views
can, because the component tree *is* the entire message. `exit()` handles this
automatically -- it freezes all interactive components and edits with the
frozen view. Understanding this distinction helps when writing custom exit or
timeout behavior.
